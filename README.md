A Python add-on for Kodi media center. Check out the anouncement on Imgur: http://imgur.com/a/MQvyE

# Quick Start
The Kodi addons are split into two projects:

* plugin.picture.imgur - Renders the UI to select Most viral / User sub and the following thumbnail views.
* script.module.imgur - Handels the thumbnail click event which opens the post. The UI toolkit provided by Kodi is very basic which makes dynamic content difficult to work with.
